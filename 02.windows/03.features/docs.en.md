The AdGuard application comprises several modules and has a broad scope of capabilities that are not limited to ad filtering. This section gives a brief overview of the AdGuard for Microsoft Windows functions and features.

## Ad Blocker

The Ad Blocker module removes all ad banners and messages from web pages. The module uses special filters that are actually sets of filtering rules.

You can temporarily turn off Ad Blocker completely if necessary, or make it unblock the useful ads. This tab also allows you to access the filter editor and block log.
