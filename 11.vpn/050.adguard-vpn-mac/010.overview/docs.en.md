AdGuard VPN for Mac is a desktop VPN service. It is currently in the beta stage, but it doesn’t mean that the app is raw. Quite the opposite, it is working stable and can be used safely. AdGuard VPN is fully compatible with AdGuard ad blocker, they can be used together and will operate seamlessly. Let’s see what features it has to offer.

Note that **you can't use AdGuard VPN for Mac unless you have logged into your AdGuard account**. You can either sign in with your AdGuard account or with an external account, namely, via Apple, Google or Facebook. Make sure that your external account is bound to the same e-mail address as your AdGuard account. If there is a suitable subscription in your AdGuard account, it will be automatically activated on the desktop app. 
Still don't have an AdGuard account? Create it [here](https://auth.adguard.com/registration.html).
 
> AdGuard VPN for Mac is currently supported on macOS versions starting from macOS Sierra (10.12).

## Home screen

<img src="https://cdn.adguard.com/public/Adguard/Blog/mac-vpn-main.png" style="border: 0px solid #efefef; max-height: 700px; max-width: 800px; padding: 2px;">

The first tab is the *Home* screen. Here you can see AdGuard VPN current status and [operating mode](#exclusions), chosen location (if enabled) and its ping. Ping is the response time of a VPN server. Consequently, the lower this number is, the faster the connection. If VPN is disabled, the last location you connected to is displayed below. The fastest locations with the lowest pings are displayed in the upper right corner of the screen. Below you can see the full list of locations. Through the search function, the needed location can be easily found. 

> Free users can connect only to certain locations, while others are blocked. Besides, there is a 3GB monthly traffic limit in the free version.

## Exclusions

<img src="https://cdn.adguard.com/public/Adguard/Blog/vpn/release/VPN_for_Mac/exclusions.png" style="border: 0px solid #efefef; max-height: 700px; max-width: 800px; padding: 2px;">

Next goes the *Exclusions* screen. AdGuard VPN has several features that make it unique, and one of them is certainly switching between two operating modes. In the Regular mode, AdGuard VPN will run on all websites but the ones from the exclusions list. In the Selective mode, conversely, AdGuard VPN will run only on websites from the exclusions list. You yourself can decide where you want VPN to work.

What’s more, ready-made exclusions lists can be transferred to other devices with installed AdGuard VPN. To export exclusions, follow the four-step instruction below:

1. Open AdGuard VPN on the device from where you want to export your lists of exclusions. Find the appropriate section and click on the *Export* button. The `exclusions.zip` archive will be downloaded.
2. There are two `.txt` files inside the archive, each for Regular and Selective lists. Add more exclusions to them, delete the existing ones, rename files (but more on this later), or just leave the archive with files as it is.
3. When transferring between different devices, don't forget to send the `.zip` file to the device for import. For example, if you import exclusion lists from your Mac to your iPhone, make sure to send the `.zip` file to your phone beforehand.
4. Open AdGuard VPN on the device/in the browser where you want to export the archive with the ready lists of exclusions. Find the appropriate section, click on the *Import* button and select the archive. Done!

> Archive files from other devices can be similarly imported to your AdGuard VPN for Mac.

Finally, we come to the most important tab — Settings. In the *About program* section you can see the current version of AdGuard VPN, check for updates, visit our official website, and get acquainted with AdGuard's EULA and Privacy policy. In the *About license* section you can upgrade from free to unlimited, manage your subscription, or log out. And most importantly, from here you can access *General settings*.

### General settings

<img src="https://cdn.adguard.com/public/Adguard/Blog/vpn/release/VPN_for_Mac/general-settings.png" style="border: 0px solid #efefef; max-height: 700px; max-width: 800px; padding: 2px;">

The first three basic features make the application more convenient and user-friendly, i.e. *autoupdate*, *launch AdGuard VPN at login*, and *auto-connect on app launch*. What’s more, you can choose between light, dark, and system themes — the latter one matches the theme on your Mac. 

Another option that shouldn't be overlooked is that you can allow AdGuard VPN to gather and send anonymized crash reports, technical and interaction data in order to help us improve our app. Last but not least, thanks to to the button on the right, you can export logs to your Mac. This can be useful if you want to attach logs to your message to support.

<a id="advanced-settings"></a>
### Advanced settings

<img src="https://cdn.adguard.com/public/Adguard/Blog/vpn/release/VPN_for_Mac/advanced-settings.png" style="border: 0px solid #efefef; max-height: 700px; max-width: 800px; padding: 2px;">

Advanced settings are not recommended to be adjusted. Don't change them unless asked by our technical support or unless you're sure what you're doing.

#### Logging level
There are only two logging levels but we strongly recommend that you use the first, default one. The second option (extended logging) should be set only to record a strange program behavior after consulting our technical support. Even if you enabled the second logging level, make sure to go back to the default one after recording logs.

#### Hide menu bar icon 
Although this option is located in *Advanced settings*, it can be enabled without hesitation. You can hide the AdGuard VPN icon from the menu bar, it won’t prevent our app from running in the background.
