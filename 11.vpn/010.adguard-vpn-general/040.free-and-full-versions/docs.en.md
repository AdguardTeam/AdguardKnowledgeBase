You can use AdGuard VPN for free, but then there will be certain restrictions:

* Only 2 devices on which you can simultaneously enable AdGuard VPN
* 3 GB of traffic per month restriction  
* 20 Mbit/sec speed limit
* Only some of the server locations are available

At the same time you can purchase a subscription to get an unlimited version of the app. 
A subscription allows to have more benefits in comparison with a free account:
 
* 5 simultaneously connected devices 
* Unlimited traffic 
* No speed cap 
* All 50+ locations are available
