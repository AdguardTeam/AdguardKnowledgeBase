<a name="msi-download"></a>

## 1. Download the MSI.

Download the [AdGuard MSI](https://cdn.adguard.com/public/Windows/AdGuard.msi).

<a name="settings-configuring"></a>

## 2. Configure the settings for your network

On machines that are joined to an Active Directory domain, policy settings may also be stored in the registry under  `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` in the following path: `Software\Policies\AdGuard\`.

The only supported policy is `LicenseKey`. If this policy is set, AdGuard will prefer it over what user can enter in the interface. This license key will be used for checking license status.

<a name="servers-available"></a>

## 3. Make sure that AdGuard servers are available

AdGuard connects to two hosts: `api.adguard.com` and `filters.adtidy.org`. Make sure that both servers are available.

<a name="msi-push"></a>

## 4. Push the MSI out to your network.

If you usually use SMS or other tools, use them to push out the AdGuard MSI just as you would normally do with any other installation bundle.

Otherwise, you can run the MSI on the target machine directly (and silently) with this command:
`Msiexec /q /i AdGuard.msi`

If you need to roll out an update, use this command:
`Msiexec AdGuard.msi /q /i AdGuard.msi REINSTALL=ALL REINSTALLMODE=vomus`

**Please note, that you must run these commands with admin privileges.**

> If you want to install AdGuard on a Windows 7 computer, make sure that it has .NET 4 Client Profile installed: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24872

<a name="installation-test"></a>

## 5. Test your installation.

On a target machine, launch AdGuard. Open the license screen to check that it uses the one you've set. You might need to click "Refresh status" to make AdGuard validate the license key.
