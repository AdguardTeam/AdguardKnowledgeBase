The owners of phones, tablets, or TVs running the Android 7+ operating system might face the problem caused by using **a profile with Restricted Mode**. If you have such a profile, **AdGuard**, like other applications that use VPN, gets restrictions on selective filtering of VPN traffic. As a result, AdGuard cannot launch protection in a **local VPN mode**. Also, one of the reasons for this situation may be using **Dual app/Dual messenger profile** on your device. Below are described the recommendations that you can apply when this problem occurs.

### Solutions

You have three ways to solve the issue:

#### Option 1: Grant permissions to AdGuard using ADB

> Please note, that this approach is available starting from **AdGuard v3.5 nightly 6**. If you're using an older version, you can get the nightly version [here](https://adguard.com/en/beta.html).

1. Activate the **developer mode** and enable **USB debugging**:
- Open the **Settings** application on your phone;
- Go to **System** section (last item in the settings menu). In this section find sub-item **About phone**;
- Click on the **Build number** line 7 times. After that, you will receive a notification that **You are now a developer** (If necessary, enter an unlock code for the device);
- Open **System Settings** > **Developer Options** > Scroll down and enable **USB debugging** > Confirm debugging is enabled in the window **Allow USB debugging** after reading the warning carefully.

>  If you have any difficulties or additional questions, full instructions can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options).

2. [Install and configure](https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/) adb; 
> On the Windows platform, **Samsung** owners may need to install [this utility](https://developer.samsung.com/mobile/android-usb-driver.html).
3. Connect your device using a **USB cable** to the computer or laptop on which you installed **ADB**;
4. Open **the command line** on your PC: 
- **Cmd.exe** if you are using **Windows**;
- **Terminal** if you are using **macOS**;
5. Enter the command `adb shell pm grant com.adguard.android android.permission.INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS` and press **Enter**.

#### Option 2: Remove *restricted user account*

About how to manage user accounts from an Android device you can [find here](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6223444?hl=en).

> Please note, that in some cases restricted user accounts are created implicitly and cannot be removed. For instance, when you use Dual messenger or Dual app features on **Samsung** or **LG** devices. You can read below how to fix the issue in these cases.

#### Option 3: Use AdGuard in *Local HTTP proxy mode* (requires root)

To enable this mode open **AdGuard Settings** > **Network** > **Filtering method** > **Local HTTP proxy**

### LG and Samsung devices

Owners of **LG** or **Samsung** phones may also encounter a similar issue. It can be caused by using **Dual app/Dual messenger** function (which automatically creates a restricted profile).
To solve this issue, you need to disable this feature.

#### Samsung

- Open **Settings**;
- Press **Advanced**;
- Scroll down, and then press **Dual messenger**;
- Disable the **Dual messenger** for all applications;
- Lock the device for 5 minutes;
- Unlock the screen and try again to create the VPN profile.

#### LG

- Open **Settings**;
- Choose **General** tab;
- Scroll down, and then press **Dual app**;
- Remove all applications from the list;
- Reboot your device.
