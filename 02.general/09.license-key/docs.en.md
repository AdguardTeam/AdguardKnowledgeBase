#### Transfering license to another device

Once the program is activated with a license key, the license key is “bound” to the device on which activation was held. License key may be activated on a limited number of devices. If the license key is already used on the maximum possible number of devices, you need to reset it before using this key again. You can do it in your [AdGuard Account](#account-functions).
