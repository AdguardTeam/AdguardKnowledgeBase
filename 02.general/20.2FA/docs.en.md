Two-factor authentication
---------------------------
Two-factor authentication (or 2FA) is an authentication method that requires an additional piece of evidence from the user to log in, on top of the usual login/password pair. Usually for this purpose websites use a code sent by SMS or via a special app.

We believe that adding a 2FA option is strictly positive, but we also realize that some users would be irritated by being forced into it. So we made it optional for your personal account on adguard.com, and by default 2FA will be disabled when you register a new one. You can enable it manually in the Settings. As for the available options, currently there is only one: an authenticator app for Android or iOS — a tried and tested 2FA method (you can use basically any such app, there are plenty).

We recommend setting up two-factor authentication for your AdGuard account. It will hardly cost you any time, but will go to great lengths to secure your license keys and, most importantly, any personal information associated with the account.


## How to set it up

1) Log into your [AdGuard account](https://auth.adguard.com/login.html) and go to the Settings tab
2) Click the "Manage 2FA" button in the bottom right corner:

3) Scan the verification code with the help of any authenticator app on your phone:

*Important*
* Save the second-factor backup code somewhere, it will be necessary to recover your account in case your mobile phone gets lost or stolen;

If everything is done right, you will see this when you log into your account the next time:

Use your mobile authenticator app to read the code and enter it. You should be logged in now!

***NOTE***: if you get the authentication error, check the clock on your phone. Correct it if needed, asynchronized clock can be the reason you get the error.
