What shall I do if the filtering in Internet Explorer doesn’t work?

Most probably it’s because you are using Windows 8 or 8.1 and enhanced protected mode is enabled in Internet Explorer. There are two solutions to this problem. 

**Option 1 - enable the WFP-drivers in the Adguard network settings.**

To do so:

1. Go to the Adguard [extended interface](https://kb.adguard.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/19/0/how-to-enter-the-adguard-extended-interface).

2. Enable WFP driver as done in the picture:

**Option 2 – disable enhanced protected mode in Internet Explorer.**

To do so:

1. Launch Internet Explorer

2. In the upper right corner of the browser’s screen click “Service” and choose “Internet options” as shown in this picture.
