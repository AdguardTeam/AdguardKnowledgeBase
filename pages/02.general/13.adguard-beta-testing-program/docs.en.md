There is&nbsp;an&nbsp;Adguard app for virtually every major platform out there, and we&nbsp;regularly release updates for all of&nbsp;them. This would not be&nbsp;possible without beta testing and, more importantly, beta testers. Want to&nbsp;become one? Here&rsquo;s how you can do&nbsp;it.<!--more-->

### How to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;beta tester

We&nbsp;do&nbsp;not have any special requirements. All you need is&nbsp;to&nbsp;use Adguard, update to&nbsp;the beta version when it&nbsp;is&nbsp;available and report all spotted bugs. One important thing, though: you will need either [forum](https://forum.adguard.com/index.php) or&nbsp;[GitHub](https://github.com/) account (or&nbsp;both :)) to&nbsp;become our beta tester&nbsp;&mdash; so&nbsp;you might want to&nbsp;get it&nbsp;over with before going further.

Now, once you have this settled, just follow one of&nbsp;these instructions, depending on&nbsp;the platform you are using:

#### Windows

Go&nbsp;to&nbsp;this [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5JWqO_Qsdri1nwJphse46Qk48YHVyc3IZs1l-XmJ3ff0dDQ/viewform) and fill all the required fields there. Make sure to&nbsp;indicate information about your PC: 

* OS&nbsp;version (x86&nbsp;or x64?);
* Browser(s) used and its version;
* Antivirus/firewall (name and version). 

It&nbsp;is&nbsp;highly recommended to&nbsp;include this information in&nbsp;your forum signature, if&nbsp;you have an&nbsp;account there.

To&nbsp;get latest beta version either activate Adguard with beta license key you will be&nbsp;provided with, or&nbsp;manually set update channel to &rsquo;Beta&rsquo; in&nbsp;Adguard settings.

Everything related to&nbsp;Adguard for Windows can be&nbsp;found and discussed&nbsp;on [GitHub](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForWindows).

#### macOS

Go&nbsp;to&nbsp;this [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5JWqO_Qsdri1nwJphse46Qk48YHVyc3IZs1l-XmJ3ff0dDQ/viewform) and fill all the required fields there. Make sure to&nbsp;indicate information about your Mac:

* OS&nbsp;version;
* Browser(s) you use and its version;
* Antivirus/firewall name and version (if&nbsp;you use&nbsp;it). 

It&nbsp;is&nbsp;highly recommended to&nbsp;include this information in&nbsp;your forum signature, if&nbsp;you have an&nbsp;account there.

To&nbsp;get latest beta version download it&nbsp;from [this link](https://static.adguard.com/mac/Adguard.beta.dmg). Once activated with beta license key you will be&nbsp;provided with, the app will use the beta channel for its updates.

* Model;
* Android version;
* Version of&nbsp;OS kernel. 

It&nbsp;is&nbsp;highly recommended to&nbsp;include this information in&nbsp;your forum signature, if&nbsp;you have an&nbsp;account there.

You will be&nbsp;provided with a&nbsp;beta license key to&nbsp;activate Adguard on&nbsp;your phone with. The latest beta can be&nbsp;always downloaded from [adguard.com/apkb](https://adguard.com/apkb) or&nbsp;by&nbsp;switching to&nbsp;beta update channel in&nbsp;Adguard settings.

**Alternative: Amazon AppStore beta**

We&nbsp;are also looking for Amazon AppStore users who are willing to&nbsp;take part in&nbsp;Adguard beta test. Just fill the same Google form, but select the respective checkbox. 

Amazon is&nbsp;a&nbsp;separate update channel, all updates are served by&nbsp;Amazon app.

Extensions for other browsers will update automatically when needed.*

### How to&nbsp;report a&nbsp;bug

Let&rsquo;s imagine the worst happened&nbsp;&mdash; you spotted a&nbsp;bug. Or&nbsp;maybe you just want to&nbsp;share your suggestion with developers? Anyway, there are several ways to&nbsp;let&nbsp;us know: 

* Go&nbsp;to [forum.adguard.com](forum.adguard.com) and post there a&nbsp;new thread (or&nbsp;find an&nbsp;existing one) in&nbsp;the beta forum [category](https://forum.adguard.com/index.php?categories/48/). Make sure to&nbsp;read [forum rules](https://forum.adguard.com/index.php?threads/14859/) first;

* Go&nbsp;to [GitHub](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/) and find a&nbsp;suitable repository. Create a&nbsp;new issue there and describe the bug/feature request in&nbsp;details;

The two methods above are highly preferable, but you can also use other, if&nbsp;needed:

* Find&nbsp;us on&nbsp;various social media, like [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/AdguardEn/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adguard/) etc. This is&nbsp;not the most convenient way to&nbsp;discuss technical matters, though.

* Contact our support team by&nbsp;sending an&nbsp;email either from in-app support tab or&nbsp;directly&nbsp;to [support@adguard.com](mailto:support@adguard.com);

### What else?

There is&nbsp;not much to&nbsp;add. You don&rsquo;t have to&nbsp;go&nbsp;out of&nbsp;your way in&nbsp;your search for bugs. You can just use Adguard in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way you normally would, just don&rsquo;t be&nbsp;lazy if&nbsp;you encounter a&nbsp;bug and report it :) Of&nbsp;course, we&nbsp;appreciate any additional effort and/or extra forum activity etc.

From time to&nbsp;time you will receive our newsletter, informing about the latest changes in&nbsp;beta version (in&nbsp;case you miss&nbsp;it) and other important news. You can unsubscribe from it&nbsp;if&nbsp;you want&nbsp;to.

And that&rsquo;s all! If&nbsp;you feel the urge to&nbsp;participate in&nbsp;Adguard beta testing program you now know what to&nbsp;do!
