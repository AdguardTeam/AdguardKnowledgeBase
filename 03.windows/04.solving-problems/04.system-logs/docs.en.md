For analysis and diagnostic of different problems connected with the work of AdGuard, support service might need Windows log files. Windows event logs contain records about all errors occurred with the software recently. Below is the brief instruction describing the way to get the log files and send them to support service. 

1. Open the **“Event Viewer”**.

If you use Windows 10, click the "**Search**" icon on the Taskbar and type in the search form field **eventvwr**.Then run the first program that will be found by clicking on **Event Viewer** icon, or just press Enter.
