## Tracking filter rules statistics
### Why do we need ads filters?
Let us begin with the definition of what ads filters are. Thanks to filters, Adguard removes ads from websites. 
They are compiled manually, based on your complaints about ads on any of the websites. This is one of the most important elements of Adguard’s work – namely the quality of ads filters determines the quality of the whole Adguard’s work.

But there is a reverse side. Over the years, there are more and more advertising filters. And the more ads filters appear, the more memory Adguard consumes and the slower are the web pages rendered. 
At the same time, some of the filters go out of the date, becoming a dead weight that is not bringing any use, only consumes memory and slows down the program work.

### Why do we need statistics?

We want to solve the problem of outdated filtering rules once and for all. But we need your help to do so. By gathering statistics on used filtering rules, we can detect and remove the rules that are no longer used. As a result, it will help all those who use Adguard.

If your computer is powerful enough, it won’t really affect you (at this time). But the difference will be very noticeable for users of low-power netbooks or tablets.

### What kind of statistics will be sent?

If you enable the «Send statistics for ad filters usage» option, the following information is sent periodically:
* Extension version
* Browser type (Chrome/Firefox/Opera/Yandex.Browser/Safari).
* List of enabled ad filters.
* The list that consists of the following elements:
  * *The domain name of the website* 
  * *The number of recent page views* 
  * *The list of filtering rules and Filter ID which were activated on this website* 
  * *The domain name of blocked requests is sent for URL rules* 
The list is created based on the website's visit statistics since the last time statistical data was sent.

The collected statistics will be sent periodically to our server for analysis and filter optimization.

### What does tracking filter rules statistics fraught with?
For the vast majority of users the change in speed of their computer will not be really noticeable. But if you use a netbook or a tablet, you may notice a slight slowdown.

Periodically, we will send the gathered statistics to the server. The size of data being sent is not very large and comparable with the size of an average web page.
