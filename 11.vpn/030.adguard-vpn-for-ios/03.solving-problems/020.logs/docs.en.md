If you encounter a problem when using AdGuard VPN for iOS, you can inform us about it by sending application logs.

## Collecting and sending standard logs

By default, AdGuard VPN for iOS uses the standard logging level, that is, the basic collection of data about running processes of the app. To send these logs, follow the next steps:

1. Open AdGuard VPN for iOS and, if possible, replay the actions that led to the error. Remember the exact time when this error occurred.

2. Select "Settings" in the lower-right corner of the screen, then select "Support" and click "Report a bug" in it.

3. In the opened form, enter your Email address for feedback and describe the error found, including the time when this error occurred. If you can't reproduce the problem, specify as accurately as possible when it last occurred.

4. There is a check mark next to the "Send detailed system info", which means that when you send a report, you also send logs.

>If for some reason it is more convenient for you to send us logs in another way, you can export them yourself. To do this, select "Export logs" in the "Support" section.

## Collecting and sending extended logs

In most cases, the default logging level is sufficient to trace down possible bugs. But there are cases when more detailed technical information about the device and connections is required, and then our support team will ask you to enable the extened logging level. To send this type of logs, follow these steps:

1. Open AdGuard VPN for iOS and select "Settings" in the lower-right corner of the screen.

2. Select "App settings" and "Advanced settings" in it.

3. In the "Logging level" section, select "Extended".

4. Replay the actions that led to the error, and remember the time when it occurred.

5. Switch the logging level back to "Default".

6. Then go back to the main section "Settings", select "Support" and then "Report a bug".

7. In the opened form, enter your Email address for feedback and describe the error found, including the time when this error occurred.

8. Make sure that there is a check mark next to "Submit detailed system info" and click "Submit a report".
