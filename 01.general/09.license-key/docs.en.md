<a id="activation_info"></a>
#### Transfering license to another device

Once the program is activated with a license key, the license key is "bound" to the device on which activation was held. A license key may be activated on a limited number of devices. If the license key is already used on the maximum possible number of devices, you need to reset it before using this key again. You can do it in your [AdGuard Account](#account-functions).


<a id="recovery"></a>
## How to recover my license key?

You can easily find which license keys belong to you in your [AdGuard Account](#account).

The binding of your license key with your account is held with your email address, which was used for the purchase of AdGuard.

**Please note** that it is often not enough to just find out what your license key is. If it was already used on another computer, it’s necessary to unbind it from that computer through the [AdGuard Account](#account) before using it again.


<a id="account"></a>
## How to register the AdGuard Account?

If you purchased an AdGuard license key, your account is already registered with the email that was used for the purchase. You will receive an email with information about the automatic registration of your personal account, as well as a link to activate it. If you haven’t received this email or forgot your password, you can [recover your password](http://adguard.com/recovery_password.html).

If you don’t have an AdGuard account, we suggest you register it by clicking [this link](http://adguard.com/register.html).

An AdGuard account gives you an opportunity to manage your license keys and their binding with your computers.

Find more about the functions of the account [below](#account-functions).


<a id="account-functions"></a>
## What functions are available in my AdGuard personal account?

When you enter the AdGuard [personal account](https://adguard.com/en/login.html) you will see the list of your license keys and their current status.

This is how you can manage your AdGuard licenses and subscriptions.

#### Renew or upgrade
You can renew your key for another year, switch to a lifetime protection, or upgrading to the family package (thus adding more devices to it).


#### Unbind from the device
If the license key is activated on one or more computers, you will see the list of these devices under the license key. A license key can be activated on a limited number of devices. Before using it again, you will have to unbind it from one of the computers.

To unbind the license key from the device, just click the cross icon next to that device, as shown in this picture:

<img src="https://cdn.adguard.com/public/Adguard/kb/newscreenshots/En/General/unbind-en.png?" max-width="900" />

#### Change card details or cancel subscription
To do so, find the subscription you need to manage and click on the card icon near it:

<a name="renewal"></a>
