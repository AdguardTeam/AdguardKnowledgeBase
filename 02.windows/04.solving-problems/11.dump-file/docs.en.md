To diagnose the reasons for certain problems that users might encounter while using AdGuard, the support team might need the dump file. The dump file is like the X-ray that helps developers to see the process that was executed in the application at the given period of time. Below you can check on the instructions of how to collect the dump file on your PC.
 
1. Please press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** and click on **Task Manager**
2. In the upper menu bar select **Details**

3. Right-click on the process that you want to create the dump file for (For example, AdGuard.BrowserExtensionHost.exe)
4. In the drop-down menu click on **Create dump file**
5. The file was created successfully!

After youâ€™ve created the dump file, please open the file location. The created dump file (.DMP) has the same name as the name of the process you chose in the previous steps. The file is quite large, so please copy it and compress it in the archive.
 
> Please note, AdGuard apps have two running processes (.exe and Svc.exe). So you need to create the dump file separately for each process.

When you send the dump files to the support team, please also send them together with the logs, so we can solve the problem. [Here](https://kb.adguard.com/en/windows/solving-problems/adguard-logs) you can check the instructions on how to collect the log file.
