## What is AdGuard VPN for iOS

A VPN allows you to create a secure connection to another network on the Internet. It connects a user's computer or mobile device to a server and allows one to browse the net using someone else's IP address. So if the VPN server is located in a different country, it will appear that you have connected to the Internet from that country, hence, plenty of resources will become available to you. [Learn more](link) about how a VPN works in detail.

Speaking of AdGuard VPN, it has several functions:
* hides your real whereabouts and helps you stay anonymous
* allows to bypass geo-blocking of some websites by hiding your location and changing your IP address
* encrypts your traffic to protect your data from tracking

## How to use AdGuard VPN for iOS

Using AdGuard VPN is quite easy. On the main screen you can see the *Connect/Disconnect* button and the lists of available servers. There servers have their own location (a certain country and a city) and ping indicator. The ping describes a response time (in milliseconds) of data submission between a user's device and a server: for example, choosing the server with the ping of 22 ms means that information from the device will reach this server in 22 milliseconds. So the lower this rate, the faster is your connection. In AdGuard VPN you can choose among over 50 locations in dozens of countries.

## Lists of exclusions

You can find the exclusion feature by tapping the middle button below. Then you will see two exclusion lists — for Regular and Selective Modes. In the Regular mode the VPN works on all websites except for the ones from the exclusion list. In the Selective mode, conversely, the VPN operates only on the sites from the list. You can add domains (e.g. `google.com`) or subdomains (e.g. `*.google.com`) of websites in two ways: you can enter them manually in the app or right from the browser by clicking the *Share* button and finding AdGuard VPN in the opened list below.

Another useful feature is the import/export of exclusion lists. You can do it by following the next four steps:

1. Open AdGuard VPN on the device/in the browser from where you want to export your lists of exclusions. Find the appropriate section and click on the *Export* button. The `exclusions.zip` archive will be downloaded.

2. There are two `.txt` files inside the archive, one for each of Regular and Selective lists. Add more exclusions to them, delete the existing ones, rename files (but more on this later), or just leave the archive with files as is.

3. When transferring between different devices, don't forget to send the `.zip` file to the device for import. For example, if you import exclusion lists from your iOS device to your Mac, make sure to send the `.zip` file to your Mac beforehand.

4. Open AdGuard VPN on the device where you want to export the archive with the ready lists of exclusions. Find the appropriate section, click on the *Import* button and select the archive.

## App settings

You can find App settings by pressing the *Settings* button in the bottom right of the screen. You can configure AdGuard VPN for iOS as you need by selecting different options.

### Operating mode

You can use the General mode with AdGuard VPN own protocol which provides the best combination of speed and security. While VPN usually can't interact with other VPN and ad blocking apps, the Integrated mode solves this problem and allows AdGuard VPN and AdGuard ad blocker to work together by using IPSec protocol. But there are some restrictions in this mode: you can't use the exclusion feature and choose a DNS server.

### DNS server

The purpose of Domain name system (DNS) is to translate websites' names into something browsers can understand, i.e. IP addresses. AdGuard VPN for iOS offers DNS servers with different fuctions. For example, AdGuard DNS removes ads and protects your device from tracking while Adguard DNS Family Protection combines the functions of AdGuard DNS with SafeSearch and adult content blocking. You can choose DNS server not only depending on its functions but also on its provider: there are the DNS servers by AdGuard, Google, Cloudfare and some others. You can find out more about DNS and its characteristics [in this article](https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/dns-filtering#what-is-dns).

### Wi-Fi auto-protection

VPN will automatically turn on when the device connects to a Wi-Fi network.

### Theme

You can choose system default, dark or light theme of the app (available in iOS 13 and later versions).

### Advanced settings

In the *Advanced settings* you can find two sections - Logging level and Diagnostic info. Concerning the first option it is not recommended to enable the Extended logging level unless required by our support team. Diagnostic info, locally stored technical information about the device and connections (IP address, ID, ping, etc.), can be sent to us in case of any technical problems.
