## Extension and Program Integration

If you already use an AdGuard app, our browser extension may become a very useful additional tool, which can completely replace the browser-based “AdGuard Assistant” module.

How does AdGuard extension work in integration mode with AdGuard for Windows or macOS?

*  Extension icon color changes to blue;

*  Extension doesn’t filter pages any more - now this function lays completely on desktop program;

*  Extension settings are ignored; instead, desktop program’s settings are used.


## Integration mode features

*  [Enable or disable filtering on a website](#1)
*  [Select and block any element manually](#2)
*  [View filtering log](#3)
*  [Send complaint on a website](#4)
*  [View website security report](#5)

###  Enable or disable filtering on a website
 	
Disabling the filtering on a website, creates an exception rule in the user filter. There are two options to enable the filtering back:

1. Using the same switcher in extension, which disabled the filtering;

The rule created by Assistant falls into the user filter. This rule can be easily removed in the program.
