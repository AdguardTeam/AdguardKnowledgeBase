AdGuard VPN has two operating modes â€” General and Integrated one. General mode is enabled by default and uses [AdGuard VPN protocol](https://kb.adguard.com/en/vpn/adguard-vpn-general/how-adguard-vpn-protocol-works). It provides the best combination of connection speed and security. However, this operating mode does not allow AdGuard VPN and AdGuard Ad Blocker to work simultaneously. In Integrated mode, in turn, the IPsec protocol is used, which makes it possible for the AdGuard applications to work together. If you already have AdGuard Ad Blocker when installing AdGuard VPN, this mode will turn on automatically and allow you to use our applications at the same time. If you installed AdGuard VPN first and only then decided to try AdGuard Ad Blocker, follow these steps to use two apps together:

1. Open AdGuard VPN for iOS and select *Settings* in the lower-right corner of the screen.

2. Go to *App settings* and select *Operating mode*.

3. Switch the mode from *General* to *Integrated*. Done!
