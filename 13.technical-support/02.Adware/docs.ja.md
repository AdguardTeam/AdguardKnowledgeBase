## Introduction

If you suspect your computer is infected by malware or viruses, first of all you can inspect your computer with utilities from leading antiviruses.

**Free antivirus utilities**

There are many of them and you can use any one you prefer, here is simply a couple examples:

[Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool](https://www.kaspersky.ru/downloads/thank-you/free-virus-removal-tool)

[Dr.Web CureIt! ](http://www.freedrweb.com/cureit/?lng=en)

If this check with antivirus utilities revealed nothing, but the computer still behaves suspiciously, try to test it for adware, which can implement its advertising on any pages that you open.

## How to clean your system from Adware?

On the Internet, you can find a lot of applications that are aimed at fighting this problem. You can use any utility you like. But we strongly recommend using **[AdwareCleaner](https://downloads.malwarebytes.com/file/adwcleaner)** by **Malwarebytes**. This application is quite easy to use and you will be able to handle it by yourself.

After the application has been downloaded and successfully installed, you should take the following steps:

1) Start the application and click **scan now**.

2) Once the scan has been completed, you will need to send suspicious objects to **quarantine**.

3) When the items are moved to **quarantine**, you will be able to **clear the system** of unnecessary ballast.
4) In some cases, you may need to **reboot the system** after cleaning is complete.

5) Once the system has been rebooted, cleaning will be completed, if necessary, you can always read the **report** on the work done.
