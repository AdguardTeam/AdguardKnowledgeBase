## Introduction 

Screenshot is a capture of your computer’s or mobile device’s screen, which can be obtained by using standard tools or a special program/app. 

Sometimes a screenshot (or screenshots) is required by support team to better understand the problem, and not everyone knows how to take screenshots, especially of a separate window or a specific screen area on their devices. If you recognize yourself as one of these users, don’t worry. This article will help you as it describes a range of ways to take screenshots on different platforms.

### Android

Taking a screenshot on an Android device can be done in various ways — depending on the device model and its manufacturer. 

Generally, you should use the following button combination for Android:

+ **Hold down at once "Volume Down" and "Power" buttons for 1–2 seconds**

Your Android device will capture the entire screen and save it as a photo. So, you can find the screenshot in a Screenshots folder in your Gallery.

But, as it has been already said, there can be differences depending on a particular device. Let’s look at other possible combinations:

+ **Hold down at once "Home" and "Power" for 1–2 seconds;**  	 
+ **Hold down at once "Back" and "Home" buttons**

On Android 8 and later there is also a possibility to take a screenshot by placing your hand vertically along the left or right edge of your phone and swiping in from that edge with your hand touching the screen.

If this method doesn’t work, check "Settings > Advanced features" to enable "Palm swipe to capture."

Besides, you can always use any special applications for taking screenshots on your devices, for example — *Screenshot Easy*, *Screenshot Ultimate*, *Screenshot Snap* etc.

### Windows

+ **To take a screenshot on Windows OS press the "PrtScn" button**

On some notebooks you have to hold **"Fn"** and then press **"PrtScn"** instead.

*Please note: PrtScn (Print Screen) button can be differently abbreviated on various keyboards — PrntScrn, PrtScn, PrtScr or PrtSc.*

Windows captures the entire screen and copies it to the (invisible) clipboard. 

To take a screenshot of an active window use the following combination:

+ **Hold down "Alt" and press "PrtScn" (or "Fn" +"Alt" + "PrtScn" on some notebooks)**

To take a screenshot of a specific area you should use the following combination:

+ **Hold down "Win" (Windows button) and "Shift" and press "S"**

After you take a screenshot (that will be saved in the clipboard), you will be able to paste it into a document that you are editing now using **"Ctrl + V"** combination. If you need a graphic file, you should open the standard **"Paint"** program (or any other that can work with images) and paste your screenshot there using the same combination or clicking **"Paste"** button in the top left corner of a page and then save it. 

Nowadays, Windows OS 8 and 10 let you take a screenshot very quickly with a **"Win + PrtScn"** combination. As soon as you press these buttons, the screenshot will be automatically saved as a file to your Pictures -> "Screenshots" Folder.

There is also a dedicated program for taking screenshots called **"Snipping Tool"** that you can find via Start menu among standard programs of your computer. Snipping Tool lets you take screenshots of any element of your desktop or the entire screen. After taking a screenshot using this program you can edit a picture and save it to any folder on your computer.

Besides, you can also try using different apps for taking screenshots on your computer, like *PicPick*, *Nimbus Screenshot*, *Screenshot Captor*, *Snipaste*, *Monosnap* etc.

+ **Hold down "⌘ Cmd" + "Shift" + "6"**

Your Mac captures the entire Touch Bar and saves it as a file on the desktop.

To copy a screenshot to the clipboard instead of saving it, hold down **"Ctrl"** together with any of the combinations above. Then you can paste the screenshot (that is in the clipboard) into a document or an image you are currently editing by using **"Ctrl + V"** combination.  

You can also take screenshots by using **"Preview"** and choosing **"Take screenshot"** (of the selected area, window, or the entire screen). With "Preview" you can save your screenshots in JPG, TIFF, PDF, and other file formats.
