AdGuard is often compared with well-known browser extensions like Adblock and Adblock Plus. In this article, we will describe the main advantages of AdGuard over its competitors.

The advantages of AdGuard apps largely originate from the limitations imposed on browser-based extensions. AdGuard processes pages even before they are loaded into the browser, removing all advertising elements. Technologically, Adblock and Adblock Plus can't remove all the ads on a page because browser extensions work on a different principle based on the ad-blocking capabilities of a browser. They require an additional page [post-processing](http://adguard.com/en/how-ads-blocked.html#cosmetic) step to hide the blocked elements. If you've ever used Adblock, then you have surely noticed how the hidden banners "blink".

The second advantage of AdGuard lies in the fact that it is a separate program, not a browser extension. AdGuard can block ads in any browser. Whether you use Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer, or Yandex – with AdGuard, you can forget about irritating online ads.

If you use a rare browser, it might pose a problem for Adblock and Adblock Plus because these extensions exist only for the most popular browsers. With AdGuard, you won’t have these problems: just add your browser to the protected list.

And that’s not all. AdGuard can block ads on Skype, uTorrent, and many other common programs. Just add them to the list of browsers and restart.

Apart from blocking ads, AdGuard gives you a lot of additional tools. Perhaps the most important of them is our Phishing Site Filter. This module uses a constantly updated database of malicious and phishing sites. Its main sources are the list of Google Safe Browsing and AdGuard’s own lists. We constantly monitor data on the safety of websites and quickly improve our filters.

Some users use AdGuard instead of an antivirus program, while others use them alongside. Either way, AdGuard seriously improves the online security of your computer.

There is a popular misconception that Adblock and Adblock Plus almost never consume resources. But is it really so?

To check this, we will use the Task Manager in the Google Chrome browser.

Note that even in the most simple settings with one single filter enabled, these extensions consume 100 megabytes of RAM. AdGuard consumes almost the same amount of resources while offering many more features.

To sum up:

**1. AdGuard blocks ads before they are loaded into the browser.**

**2. AdGuard really saves your traffic.**

**3. AdGuard is compatible with all browsers.**

**4. AdGuard can remove ads from Skype, uTorrent, and other applications.**

**5. AdGuard helps protect you from viruses and scams.**
