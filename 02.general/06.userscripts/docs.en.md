## Introduction

<a name="intro"></a>

Starting from version 5.9 it became possible to install userscripts in AdGuard for Windows.

First of all, we need to understand what it is. Userscript is a script written in Javascript that extends the functionality of one or more sites. AdGuard users already know about such extensions. Among them are the [PopupBlocker](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/PopupBlocker) that blocks all unwanted pop-up windows, and the [AdGuard Assistant](https://github.com/AdGuardTeam/adguardassistant) which helps to manage filtering right from the browser. You can see its icon in the corner of any web page.

As it was mentioned, AdGuard for Windows can work as a userscript manager. The detailed information about how to install userscripts in AdGuard you will find in the [Extensions](https://kb.adguard.com/en/windows/features/extensions) article of our Knowledgebase.

## Where can you get userscripts?

Userscripts are mostly created by enthusiasts, that is why you need to be careful when installing a userscript. But, nevertheless, there is a great variety of interesting scripts that can really make the use of some websites more convenient.

There are several popular userscript catalogues. We will describe them in this article.

## Userstyles.org

[Userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/) is a catalogue of user styles, but it allows you to load them as userscripts. Thus, any user style can be installed via AdGuard.
