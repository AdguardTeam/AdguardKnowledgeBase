Phishing is a very common web fraud aimed at stealing your personal data (passwords, bank account details, etc.). It is carried out using fake web pages mimicking popular websites or real services, such as web stores or social networks. Many phishing websites have URLs that only differ from the real ones in just a few symbols to put off your guard. If a user enters their details on such a website, they will definitely end up in the hands of criminals.

Browsing Security gives strong protection against such incidents. At the same time, the userâ€™s personal information is not transferred anywhere, and AdGuard servers do not know which websites the user is visiting, because security check is not performed via open web address (URL) but through hash prefixes (hash is a certain data structure that renders each address added to the base unambiguous).

Some web pages are not malicious themselves, but they may contain elements built into their structure by other websites. Unlike browser plug-ins, Browsing Security module checks each object built into any web page, thus ensuring maximum protection.
