The following extensions are installed with AdGuard:

### AdGuard Assistant

The name of this extension is quite deliberate: it actually assists the user in changing basic AdGuard settings in the browser, without the need to open the app itself. AdGuard Assistant works with all macOS compatible browsers. In addition, the AdGuard Assistant icon will not be displayed on websites listed as exceptions by the user and on certain web pages where there is a risk of incorrect content display.

### AdGuard Popup Blocker

This extension prevents popup windows from opening when you view web pages. Some popups are considered useful – they may contain settings for site administering or additional reference information demonstrated upon clicking a link. That is why you can turn off the Blocker if needed. This extension doesn’t work on websites added to the AdGuard exceptions list either. It is turned off by default, but you can turn it on in the application settings.

### Web of Trust

Web of Trust lets you see the reputation of each website based on its users’ opinions. The site is rated by a number of specific criteria: trust, security, etc. This extension is turned off by default, but you can turn it on in the application settings.
