## What is Adguard DNS?
Adguard DNS is a free Domain Name System resolution system. You can use it for adblocking purposes instead of your current DNS provider.

<a id="why-use"></a>
## Why use Adguard DNS?

—  Doesn’t require you to install any external apps. All you have to do is to follow a short manual how to configure it.

—  Adguard DNS is completely free for personal use. You don’t install anything, so there is nothing to pay for :)

— Works in two modes: regular ad blocking and ’Family protection’ mode.

—  We do not save **any personal data** and do not log any of your actions. Your privacy will remain safe.

—  Can be used on any device: Windows, macOS, Android, iOS

<a id="how-works"></a>
## How does Adguard DNS work?

When you use Adguard DNS, every time a website sends an ad request, our server sends back a null response. Adguard has a database of domain names that serve for ad purposes, and this database is regularly updated.

<a id="what-else"></a>
## What can Adguard DNS do except for blocking ads?

We offer two different modes. ’Default’ mode includes blocking ads, various trackers and malware & phishing websites. ’Family protection’ does the same, but also blocks websites with adult content and enforces ’safe search’ in your browser.

<a id="dnscrypt"></a>
## What is DNSCrypt?
Instead of a regular client-server interaction protocol, Adguard DNS allows you to use a specific encrypted protocol - DNSCrypt. Thanks to it, all DNS requests are being encrypted, which protects you from possible request interception and subsequent eavesdropping and/or alteration. You can find a separate configuration manual for each platform [here](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/instruction.html#dnscrypt).


<a id="devices"></a>
## What devices can I use Adguard DNS with?

There are no restrictions for which devices you can use it with. You can find a separate configuration manual for each platform [here](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/instruction.html#instruction).

<a id="free"></a>
## Why is Adguard DNS free? What’s the catch?

We will use Adguard DNS functionality as a part of other Adguard software, which will be distributed on a pay-to-use basis. We might also develop a paid version of Adguard DNS based on current one, more advanced and with more features.
