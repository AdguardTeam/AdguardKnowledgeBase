If you suspect your computer is infected by malware or viruses, first of all you need to check your computer with free utilities from leading antiviruses.

**Free antivirus utility **

[Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool](https://www.kaspersky.ru/downloads/thank-you/free-virus-removal-tool)

[Dr.Web CureIt! ](http://www.freedrweb.com/cureit/?lng=en)

If this check with antivirus utilities revealed nothing, but the computer still behaves suspiciously, try to test it for adware, which can implement its advertising on any pages that you open. To do that you can use free software [AdwCleaner](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/). Try to remove all the adware it found. 


If it didn’t help - disable all settings in the browser in which this situation occurred. Use [this instructions](#instruction). 

If disabling of settings and extensions does not help, try to [re-create shortcuts of your browsers](#shortcuts).

Below on this page we’ve described the instructions for removing some of the most popular ad extensions.

### How to re-create shortcuts of your browsers?

The simplest solution in this case is to manually delete all the shortcuts and recreate them by yourself.
