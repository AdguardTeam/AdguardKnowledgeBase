In Android 9 and later, if AdGuard is installed for more than one user account on your device, you may encounter problems with removing the app. When you delete AdGuard from one user account, the app will still show up on the list of applications, but you canâ€™t uninstall or reinstall it. It happens because AdGuard is installed for another user account on the device.
 
If you try to reinstall AdGuard after a failed attempt of removal, you will see the error "You can't install the app on your device".
 
To solve this problem you need to delete the application for all users: go to Settings -> All apps -> AdGuard. Tap three dots at the upper right corner and then tap *Uninstall for all users*.
