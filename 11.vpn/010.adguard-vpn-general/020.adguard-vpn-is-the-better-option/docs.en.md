When getting ready to commit to a [long-term VPN subscription](https://adguard-vpn.com/en/license.html), users most frequently evaluate its speed, security, and price. Those are very important points but there is so much more! **There is a dozen of key assets that make AdGuard VPN unique**. Let’s look at each of them separately to see why AdGuard VPN is one of a kind and how to use it to its fullest extent.  

*To start with, let’s go over AdGuard VPN’s unmatched features that you won’t find in any other VPN.*

## 1. Proprietary protocol
From the very outset, we resolved to develop and deploy an in-house VPN protocol instead of picking a canned solution — that’d be too easy, plus, we weren’t satisfied with existing protocols. The result has become the [AdGuard VPN protocol](https://kb.adguard.com/en/vpn/adguard-vpn-general/how-adguard-vpn-protocol-works).

Choosing a VPN service, people often face a trade-off between fast vs. safe. The AdGuard VPN protocol is a perfect blend of speed and security, so you don’t have to bear slow internet connection or make privacy sacrifices. Among other things, it disguises itself as regular traffic and it’s much harder to detect and block it.

## 2. Exclusions 
The *Exclusions lists* allow you to select sites for which the VPN should be enabled and for which — disabled.
There are two operation modes in AdGuard VPN. In *Regular mode*, VPN works everywhere except websites added to exclusions. And vice versa, in *Selective mode*, VPN works nowhere but on websites added to exclusions. You can also easily import/export exlcusions lists. Read about this feature in *Features overview* for the platform of your device.

Now, you may ask, which mode to choose? Practice shows that users prefer *Selective* one which makes sense, given the use cases. Most often users need VPN only on certain websites, the blocked ones or the ones that might mine extensive amounts of data. To save VPN traffic and not to sacrifice speed, using Selective mode seems sound. But other users might prefer absolute protection, and using *Regular mode* is the optimum solution for them.

> In less than a month we will add a new feature. There will be a list of services sorted by category that you’ll be able to add to exclusions at the touch of a button. 

## 3. Choosing a DNS server
No more relying on the DNS server provided by your ISP by default! First, it’s not safe: your ISP most likely has access to your browsing history. Second, People often underestimate DNS, yet it can remove ads and trackers, protect your device from malware or, for instance, enable safe search and block adult content.
    
From now you can choose DNS servers from [known DNS providers](https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/dns-providers) such as AdGuard, Cisco, Cloudflare, Google, or Quad9, or even configure to use your own DNS server. 

## 4. Fastest locations

Another feature that makes AdGuard VPN stand out from the crowd is that you can select a location based on its ping. In a nutshell, ping is the time it takes the data packet sent from your computer to reach the server and return. When in doubt, use a rule of thumb: the lower the ping, the closer the server, the higher its speed. We are constantly expanding the number of locations so that you can choose from a variety.

> Note that to access all VPN server locations, you need to purchase an AdGuard VPN subscription.

## 5. Compatibility with AdGuard ad blocker

With desktop apps and browser extensions this goes without saying — there’s rarely any conflicts between apps, save for antiviruses and other similarly oriented software.

With mobile devices, on the other hand, it’s not that simple. In the vast majority of cases, two VPN-based apps will not work together, just because certain OS-induced limitations exist that prevent that from happening, both on Android and iOS.

However, we managed to find a solution to befriend AdGuard VPN and AdGuard ad blocker. When you have both AdGuard apps installed on one device simultaneously, they will automatically become compatible without any input required from you. This is a unique opportunity to take advantage of two sets of features, which you would normally have to choose between.
    
## 6. QUIC support (experimental)
[QUIC](https://adguard.com/en/blog/dns-over-quic.html#whatisquic) is a cutting-edge protocol that has many perks. The main advantage is it can improve connection quality in non-ideal conditions – for example, on mobile devices or when connecting to public Wi-Fi. Although the new protocol won’t affect speed when the connection is fine and stable, it will definitely make the situation better for users with slow internet.
    
> QUIC support is currently in the testing stage and may not work correctly at the moment. In the near future we will fix all the problems and tell you more about this protocol.     

*Now let’s switch to the item set that any decent VPN can't do without.* 

## 7. Kill Switch
Kill Switch is essential if you, for instance, often use a mobile network or connect to public Wi-Fi networks in malls, cafes, on the subway or at the airport. For the simple reason — if VPN will suddenly drop and the connection will become insecure, chances are that your sensitive information will be exposed to fraudsters or cyber criminals.

If for some reason your VPN connection is interrupted, Kill Switch will automatically disconnect the internet connection, keeping attackers away from seizing your information. With Kill Switch, rest assured that you are in safe hands. If you’re concerned about privacy or at least value your personal data, don’t overlook this bulletproof method.

## 8. Split tunneling
This feature resembles the exclusions lists mentioned above. The only difference is that here you can exclude apps instead of websites.

> Split tunneling is currently available in AdGuard VPN for Android, Windows, and Mac.
 
## 9. Auto-Protection
This feature has been developed specifically for unsecured networks. For the convenience of users, we made it impossible to forget to enable VPN when visiting public places. Should you pop into a coffee shop and connect to a local Wi-Fi network, you’ll be automatically connected to AdGuard VPN.

> Auto-protection is currently available in AdGuard VPN for iOS, it’ll appear in AdGuard for Android in 2 weeks since the publication. Also, this feature is coming soon on AdGuard VPN for Windows and Mac.

## 10. Simultaneous connection allowance
AdGuard VPN offers five simultaneous connections to its paid users. We place special emphasis on the word ’*simultaneous*’, and here is why. Some VPN providers only allow to log in to their service on *five devices max*. With AdGuard VPN, *there’s no limit* to the number of devices that can be logged in to your account, but you can have five VPN connections enabled at the same time. Those who don’t have a subscription can use AdGuard VPN on *two devices*, which gives us another trump card to play against competitors — most of the VPN services only have *one device* in their free versions.

## 11. Streaming support  
According to statistics, about 20% of VPN users install it primarily to binge-watch shows, series and films on streaming services. The problem is it’s not easy to outsmart streaming services as they can detect VPNs and block sneaky users access to their platform.

We strived to implement streaming support so that AdGuard VPN could easily bypass the restrictions, operate seamlessly on all most popular streaming services and stay undetected by them. And it seems like we’ve managed to!

| Streaming platform        | Available countries           |
| ------------- |-------------: |
| Netflix      | USA, UK, Germany |
| Disney+      | USA, UK, Germany      | 
| Amazon Prime | USA, UK      |
| HBO Max | USA      |
| Hulu | USA      |
| BBC iPlayer | UK      |    
    
There are six streaming platforms you can access via AdGuard VPN for now but we plan to add to this list. To know more about this feature, read [this article](https://adguard.com/en/blog/streaming-support-vpn.html).  

## 12. Dark mode

This little ‘feature’ deserves special mention. In fact, many users crave for dark mode, so we couldn’t ignore it and added a theme switch for all AdGuard VPN products. Choose the one you like more — light, dark, or system. Hope you’ll join the dark side :)
