### What is AdGuard VPN?
AdGuard VPN a virtual private network (VPN), which is a secure tunnel between two or more devices.
Connecting to a VPN gives you an encrypted connection to the Internet. This allows you to stay private, stay secure, and access the online content you want — no matter where you are.
If you are interested in more details on what VPN is and how it works, check [this article](https://adguard.com/en/what-is-vpn.html).
 
### Why do I need VPN?
A VPN is a multi-purpose digital survival tool. You can use your VPN to:
* Hide your real IP address, which reveals a lot about you — like your real geolocation, comments on forums, torrent downloads, and more, and surf the web with added privacy.
* Shield yourself from snoopers & hackers from accessing your files, messages, or other private information on public Wi-Fi.
* Unblock and access your favorite websites and social media platforms.
* Stream and download anything securely, anonymously, and with no limits.
* Get discounts when you shop online (local prices and special offers are sometimes more favorable).

### What makes AdGuard VPN better than other VPNs?
Over the years we proved that we can be trusted, and 20M+ users agree. We have a strict no logging policy and we even developed our own safe protocol specifically for AdGuard VPN. Our VPN service has several advantages over its competitors. We provide unique features like domain exclusions and custom DNS servers (more [here](LINK NEEDED)).

### What are the advantages of AdGuard VPN protocol?
While there are other tested and proven solutions, AdGuard offers an unparalleled level of security compared to other popular communication protocols. Combined with high speed and reliability, it's a perfect choice for a multipurpose VPN service like AdGuard.
 
### How do I install AdGuard VPN?
Detailed installation manuals for all platforms are available [in this article](https://kb.adguard.com/en/vpn/installation).

### Why is there “Beta” in the name of AdGuard VPN?
Beta means that we will be updating the extension frequently. You still can use AdGuard VPN without any constraints. We would like you to ask questions and share feedback about the app’s performance.

### Do you log my data?
AdGuard VPN is a privacy-focused company that does not share or sell any of your personal data. We are proud to say that we fight for users' privacy and we are strongly committed to this principle and to being as transparent as possible.
 
**We do not store activity logs or connection logs of our users**. AdGuard VPN does collect minimal information about the usage of our services in order to identify and address technical issues, but this information cannot be used to connect you to any specific activity or behavior. For more information on what data and how exactly we process, please check our [Privacy policy](https://adguard-vpn.com/privacy.html).

### What is the best server for me to connect to?
In order to pick the best server to connect, you need to decide what you are going to be using the VPN for and then choose a server accordingly. See common uses below:

**For Anonymity**:
If you are connecting strictly for anonymity, connect to the country and city closest to your location.

**To Change Your Location**:
If you are connecting in order to hide your actual location, choose a location in which you wish to be identified.

**For Fastest Speed**:
On our locations screen in AdGuard VPN app or extension, select the **Fastest** option before you click “Connect” to enable the VPN.
