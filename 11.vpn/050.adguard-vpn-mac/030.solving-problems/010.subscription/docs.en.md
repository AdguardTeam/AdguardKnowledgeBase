The free version of AdGuard VPN for macOS has 3 GB of monthly traffic, about 10 locations in different countries and the ability to work on two devices simultaneously. If you want to use the app without restrictions, you can purchase a [subscription](link).

There are two ways to do this:

1. You can subscribe to AdGuard VPN on [our website](https://adguard-vpn.com/license.html) or by clicking **Upgrade** in the lower right corner of the app. Choose a convenient subscription plan (monthly or yearly), enter the email address to which a receipt will be sent, and click **Buy now**. Pay the bill using your credit card or PayPal account. Ready!

2. You can also purchase a subscription in [your AdGuard account](https://my.adguard.com/en/main.html), if you have one. Log in to your account and select **My licenses** from the menu above. Click **Buy now** next to **AdGuard VPN** and select a monthly or yearly subscription. Pay for it using your credit card or PayPal account. Done!
