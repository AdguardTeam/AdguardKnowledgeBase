AdGuard VPN Browser extension is available for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. Its UI and functionality don’t differ so the overview below will be relevant for AdGuard VPN extension for all browsers.

> Note that you can only use the AdGuard VPN Browser extension when logged in. Sign in with your AdGuard account or via Google, Facebook, or Apple. In the latter case make sure that your account is bound to the same email address as your AdGuard account. If you have an AdGuard VPN subscription, it will be activated automatically in the AdGuard VPN Browser extension. Don’t have an AdGuard account yet? [Create it here](https://auth.adguard.com/registration.html).

## Exclusions
The first tab contains one of the main distinctive features of AdGuard VPN – two operation modes with exclusions lists.

In Regular mode, AdGuard VPN by default works on all websites, with the exception of websites you add to the exclusions list. In Selective mode, vice versa, AdGuard VPN by default doesn't work anywhere. You can add any websites where you'd like it to work to another list, separate from the one you see in the Regular mode.

Not only can you add and remove websites, you can also transfer ready exclusions lists to other devices where AdGuard VPN is installed. To export your exclusions list, follow the 4-step instruction below:

1. Open the AdGuard VPN Browser extension from where you want to export your lists of exclusions. Find the appropriate section and click the "Export" button. The exclusions.zip archive will be downloaded.
2. There are two `.txt` files inside the archive, one for each of the Regular and Selective lists. Add more exclusions to them, delete the existing ones, rename files, or just leave the archive as it is.
3. When transferring between different devices, send the `.zip` file to the device for import.
4. Open AdGuard VPN on that device. Find the appropriate section, click the "Import" button and select the archive.
Done!

## Settings

A few important settings are gathered on this tab. Here you can choose a DNS server to use, add or remove the AdGuard VPN item from the browser’s context menu, block WebRTC, and allow AdGuard to gather crash reports and technical data, all anonymized.

### How to choose a DNS server

By default, the [system DNS server](https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/dns-filtering#what-is-dns) provided by your ISP is selected, but it may compromise your privacy. With the AdGuard VPN Browser extension, you can select any DNS server that will block ads, potentially dangerous domains, or do something else useful. Brief descriptions under the names of DNS servers will help you navigate and make your mind. Learn more about [DNS servers from various providers] (https://kb.adguard.com/ru/general/dns-providers).

## Account

The third tab of the AdGuard VPN Browser extension is utterly minimalistic, containing only the email address you used to sign in to your account and two buttons, “Manage” and “Sign out”. Clicking the "Manage" button takes you to your personal AdGuard account, where you can see all your current licenses and subscriptions, as well as devices connected to them.

### How to get started with using the AdGuard VPN Browser extension

It's pretty easy.

1. Select your browser and click "Try for free" [on the AdGuard VPN website](https://adguard-vpn.com/en/welcome.html).
2. Depending on your browser, one of the websites will open: Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, or Microsoft Edge Add-ons. Click "Install" next to the AdGuard VPN Browser extension.
3. Once the installation is complete, you will be prompted to switch to [full version](https://adguard-vpn.com/thankyou.html). It’s not that you have to do this, but if you find that the free version is not enough for you, you can purchase a subscription at any moment.
4. To make it more convenient, you can pin the AdGuard VPN Browser extension icon to your browser’s toolbar. For instance, in Chrome, you need to click on the puzzle icon in the top right corner and then on the pin icon next to AdGuard VPN.
5. Accept EULA and Privacy Policy by checking the appropriate box. You can also allow AdGuard VPN to collect anonymized data on the app usage, which we use to improve our product (this is optional). Then click "Continue".
6. Sign up or log in to your previously created AdGuard account.
Done!

If you have bought a subscription, you can check its status and, if necessary, renew it [in your AdGuard account](https://my.adguard.com/en/main.html).

### Benefits of the AdGuard VPN Unlimited subscription

In the free version the [extension’s functionality is limited](placeholder): you can’t use more than 3 GB per month, the connection speed is capped at 20 Mbit/s, and some server locations are unavailable locations.

[The subscription](https://adguard-vpn.com/en/license.html) allows you to use AdGuard VPN without any restrictions, whether it be traffic-, speed-, or location-related. Another advantage is that you can use unlimited AdGuard VPN on up to five devices at the same time, while the free version only allows two. Read about all the advantages of the paid version in [this article](placeholder).
