This is the main module of AdGuard for macOS that filters off ads on websites viewed by the user and in the user’s installed apps. Ad Blocker clears web pages of advertising images and messages using specific rules. The undesirable content is filtered even before the page is loaded in the browser, which helps save a lot of traffic.

Ad Blocker is flexibly adjusted to your needs, so you can add any object on pages you are viewing to the blocking rules, or turn off filtering on select websites. There is an option of completely halting the module and resuming its work when needed. Ad Blocker filters are updated automatically; however, you can change the User Filter parameters by editing the list of website URLs in its settings.

AdGuard works well with all macOS compatible browsers, therefore Ad Blocker will successfully filter ads in any website-viewing application you may use.

To turn Ad Blocker on or off, click on the AdGuard icon in the macOS ribbon and slide the Ad Blocker switch left or right in the window that opens.

AdGuard provides users with numerous filters that let you fine-tune blocking properties. Filters receive automatic updates from AdGuard servers. Our specialists create them all manually based on user data received. You can always help other AdGuard users by sending us website URLs that you have still seen ads at.

To turn filters on and off, click on the Filters icon in the upper section of the AdGuard Settings window.

The following filters are installed and turned on by default:

**User Filter**

A filter that you edit yourself. You can either add rules with AdGuard Assistant or do it manually with the help of our rule setting guide. E.g., it’s convenient against annoying pictures in forum signatures.

**Russian filter**

Rules of this filter are enough to block all ads on any Russian website.

**English filter**

Clears ads from English websites.

**Useful ads filter**

Allows search ads and website own adverts (sales, promo offers, etc.). [Which ads do we consider useful?](https://adguard.com/en/whitelist.html)

**Spyware filter**

Protects user’s personal information from spyware and statistics gathering systems by blocking relevant requests from websites.

To add a new filter to the list of active filters, click on the “+” button in the lower left corner of the AdGuard Settings – Filters window. Check the filters you’d like to install in the new window and click on the Add button.
