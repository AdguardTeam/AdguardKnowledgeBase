#### Transfering license to another device

Once the program is activated with a license key, the license key is “bound” to the device on which activation was held. License key may be activated on a limited number of devices. If the license key is already used on the maximum possible number of devices, you need to reset it before using this key again. You can do it in your [AdGuard Account](#account-functions).


<a id="recovery"></a>
## How to recover my license key?

You can easily find out which license keys belong to you in your [AdGuard Account](#account).

The binding of your license key with your account is held with your email address, which was used for purchasing of AdGuard.

**Please note** that it is often not enough to just find out what your license key is. If it was already used on another computer, it’s necessary to unbind it from that computer through the [AdGuard Account](#account) before using it again.
