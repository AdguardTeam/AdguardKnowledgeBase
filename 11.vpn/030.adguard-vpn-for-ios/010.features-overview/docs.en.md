## VPN itself

Captain Obvious: AdGuard VPN provides...VPN! And it has many benefits. First of all, our VPN allows to bypass geo-blocking of some websites by changing an IP adress. Secondly, it encrypts your traffic to fully protect your data. The next advantage of AdGuard VPN for iOS is our own VPN protocol, the reliable feature for uncompromised security. And, of course, there is a wide range of the lightning-fast servers. How many exactly? 50 locations worldwide! Choose the most suitable and surf the web!

## Lists of exclusions

AdGuard VPN for iOS has two exclusion lists â€” for Regular and Selective Modes. It can work either on all websites except those added to exclusions, or only on websites added to exclusions. You can add domains (e.g. google.com) or subdomains (e.g. *google.com) to both lists and switch from one to another if necessary. Another great feature is function of the import/export of exclusion lists. How to do it easily you can read [here](https://adguard.com/en/blog/import-export-adguard-vpn.html).
