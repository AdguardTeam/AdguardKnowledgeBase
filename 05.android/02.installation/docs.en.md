## System  requirements

**OS version:** Android 4.0.3 or higher.

**RAM:** at least 700 MB.

**Free disk space:** 30 Mbytes.

## Installation
Most Android-based apps are distributed via Google Play Market; however, AdGuard is not presented there, because Google prohibits distribution of network-level ad blockers via Google Play, i.e. apps that block commercials in other apps. You will find more information about Google restrictive policy [in our blog](https://blog.adguard.com/en/google-removes-adguard-android-app-google-play/).

That’s why you can only install AdGuard for Android manually. To use the app on your mobile device, you will need to do the following.

First of all, allow installing apps from unknown sources in your device’s OS settings. For this you will need to:

* For Android 6: open **Settings**, then select **Additional settings** in **System & Device**. Switch on **Unknown sources** and press **OK** in the system warning window.
* For Android 4 and 5: open **Settings**, then select **Security** in the **Personal** section. Switch on **Unknown sources** (in Android 4, there is a checkbox instead of a switch) and press **OK** in the system warning window.
