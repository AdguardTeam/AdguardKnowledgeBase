There is&nbsp;an&nbsp;AdGuard app for virtually every major platform out there, and we&nbsp;regularly release updates for all of&nbsp;them. This would not be&nbsp;possible without beta testing and, more importantly, beta testers. Want to&nbsp;become one? Here&rsquo;s how you can do&nbsp;it.<!--more-->

### How to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;beta tester

We do not have any special requirements. All you need is to use AdGuard, update to the beta version when it's available, and report all spotted bugs. However, you will need either a [forum] (https://forum.adguard.com/index.php) or a [GitHub] (https://github.com/) account (or both:)) to become our beta tester, so you may want to get that out of the way first.

In any case, every single thing you need to know is gathered on a [dedicated page](https://adguard.com/en/beta.html).

If you want to skip the description part and get right to the deal, you can submit an application [here](https://surveys.adguard.com/beta_testing_program/form.html). It will be reviewed within 1-3 working days, and you'll get a reply via email.

### How to&nbsp;report a&nbsp;bug

Let’s imagine the worst happened — you spotted a bug. Or maybe you just want to share your suggestion with developers? Anyway, there are several ways to let us know:

* Go to [forum.adguard.com](forum.adguard.com) and post there a new thread (or find an existing one) in the beta forum [category](https://forum.adguard.com/index.php?categories/48/). Make sure to read [forum rules](https://forum.adguard.com/index.php?threads/14859/) first;

* Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/) and find a suitable repository. Create a new issue there and describe the bug/feature request in detail.

The two methods above are highly preferable, but you can also use others, if needed:

* Find us on various social media, like [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/AdguardEn/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adguard/) etc. This is not the most convenient way to discuss technical matters, though.

* Contact our support team by sending an email either from in-app support tab or directly to [support@adguard.com](mailto:support@adguard.com);

### How to activate the beta key in the iOS application:

If you have already received a beta key and it is displayed in the list in your account on adguard.com, just go to the application and open the license section (Get Premium). Here you need to enter your credentials from your AdGuard account. After that, premium features will become available automatically.

### What else?

There is not much more to add. You don't have to go out of your way to find bugs. You can continue to use AdGuard as usual. However, if you encounter a bug, please do not be lazy in reporting it. Of course, we appreciate any additional effort and/or extra forum activity, etc.

From time to time, you will receive our newsletter, informing you about the latest changes in beta version (in case you missed it) and other important news. You can unsubscribe from it if you want to.

And that’s all! If you feel the urge to participate in AdGuard beta testing program, you now know what to do!
