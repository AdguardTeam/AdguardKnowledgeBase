AdGuard Safari Web extension (not to be confused with [AdGuard for Safari](https://kb.adguard.com/en/safari), which is de-facto a browser extension for Safari browser on Mac) is a tool that takes advantage of the new features of iOS 15. It serves to enhance the capabilities of AdGuard for iOS or AdGuard Pro for iOS. With it, AdGuard apps can apply advanced filtering rules and ultimately block more ads.

### Enabling Safari Web extension

Safari Web extension is not a standalone tool and requires an AdGuard app to work. If you don't have AdGuard for iOS or AdGuard Pro installed on your device, please [install one of them first](https://kb.adguard.com/en/ios/installation) and complete the onboarding process to prepare it for work.

Once done, open *Settings > Safari > Extensions*. Find **Allow these extensions** tab and then find **AdGuard** among the available extensions. Tap it, then turn on the switch. On the same screen make sure that AdGuard extension has the required permissions: **All Websites** should have the *Allow* status. 

>Safari Web extension requires access to the web pages' content to operate, but doesn't use it for any purpose other than blocking ads.

You can also turn AdGuard extension on from the Safari browser. Find the jigsaw piece icon in the address bar and tap it (depending on your device type it may be located to the left or to the right). Then tap *Manage Extensions* button and in the prompted window find and enable **AdGuard** extension. Although in this case you may have to go to Safari settings to grant AdGuard extension the necessary permissions anyway.

You should now be able to see the AdGuard icon in the Safari browser's address bar. Tap it, and then tap on the yellow **i** icon. Enable **Advanced protection** by tapping the *Turn on* button and confirming the action.

>If you use AdGuard for iOS without Premium subscription, you won't be able to enable **Advanced protection**. 

Alternatively, you can enable **Advanced protection** directly from the app, in the **Protection** tab (second from the left in the bottom icon row). 

Safari web extension only works on iOS versions 15 and later.
