AdGuard has been created to make your browsing experience pleasant and comfortable. It is not just a web filter and ad blocker – it is a convenient and fully adjustable tool that helps you save your traffic, load your web pages faster, and protect your computer from undesirable and potentially malicious content. With AdGuard, you can forget all about annoying banners and popup windows. This is not the whole scope of the application’s capabilities, though. AdGuard will protect you from phishing websites, and your children from information they should not yet come across due to age restrictions. However, everything in its turn.

Adguard 的主要功能是过滤您所访问网站上的广告。无论您在使用什么浏览器 – AdGuard 都能与任何网页查看程序完美契合。如您的浏览器未包含在默认的列表上，您可毫不费力的手动添加它们。除了利用预制的过滤器集合外，您也可选择要阻止的网页项目或关闭对某网站的过滤。AdGuard 不仅能过滤网页内置的横幅广告，也能防止自动弹出及播放线视频时的广告剪辑。

AdGuard for Windows 最重要的一个特性便是在广告加载到浏览器之前就先滤除它，从而显著降低因特网数据共享（对于付费流量，它是一个重要的因素）并加速网络冲浪。除了过滤广告，AdGuard for Windows 也保护用户远离潜在的恶意软件，间谍软件及诈骗网站。称之为网络钓鱼的因特网网站尤为值得关注。

>网络钓鱼是一种常见的网络欺诈，旨在窃取您的个人数据（密码，银行账户详细信息等）。其是通过伪网页仿冒流行网站或真实服务而实施的，例如网络商店或社交网络。

AdGuard for Windows 的专用模块，即安全浏览，保护用户远离此种欺诈，对重定向到潜在恶意网站的尝试进行警告。安全浏览数据库是自动更新的，并始终处于最新状态。

Every person working on the Internet leaves invisible footsteps there: counters built in websites gather information about their IP-address (and, therefore, about their current location), their browser version, operating system, screen resolution, and lots of other data. A site can mark your browser with cookies to gather your statistics, save your settings, or automatically identify you upon repeat visit. Your personal data and private information will be secure with another AdGuard module called Stealth Mode. Stealth Mode will always keep you safe and sound.

The Internet may be a dangerous place for young users. Violence, adult themes, crude language, gambling, drug propaganda – this list is far from complete where it concerns the information children should be restricted from. AdGuard Parental Control module will help you with this. Just turn it on, set the filter sensitivity, and you don’t have to worry that your child will stumble upon an inappropriate website anymore. Parental Control also allows you to turn on filtering of search results and set a password to protect AdGuard settings. Now you won’t need to buy separate applications to filter web content – with AdGuard, your family will always be well-protected.
