Starting with Adguard 5.7, we provide two options of the internet traffic filtering you can choose from. The new and modern WFP driver is used by default in Windows 8.

Unfortunately, WFP although very promising is quite a new one and therefore is not completely well-adjusted. That is why sometimes compatibility errors of our WFP-drivers with drivers of some antiviruses occur. These errors can be very different in each case.

You can always switch to the old and stable network driver.

To do so:

1. Go to Adguard General Settings.

2. Disable WFP driver as it’s done in this picture:
