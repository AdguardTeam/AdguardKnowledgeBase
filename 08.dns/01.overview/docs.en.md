AdGuard DNS is a foolproof way to block Internet ads that does not require installing any applications. It is easy to use, absolutely free, easily set up on any device, and provides you with minimal necessary functions to block ads, counters, malicious websites, and adult content.

To start using AdGuard DNS, set up the addresses of Domain Name System (DNS) instead of those given by your service provider. AdGuard DNS is free of charge for personal use.

When you use AdGuard DNS, every time a website sends an ad request our server sends back an empty response. AdGuard has its own base of domain names that send ads, and it is regularly updated. We offer two modes for AdGuard DNS to work in. The Default Mode includes blocking ads, counters, malicious and phishing websites. The Family Mode does the same, in addition blocking adult content and enabling safe search for your browser.

AdGuard DNS can work on any devices, including smartphones and tablet PCs. There are no equipment limitations.
