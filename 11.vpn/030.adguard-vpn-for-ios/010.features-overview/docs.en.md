## What is AdGuard VPN

A VPN allows you to create a secure connection to another network on the Internet. It connects a user's computer or mobile device to a server and allows one to browse the net using someone else's IP address. So if the VPN server is located in a different country, it will appear that you have connected to the Internet from that country, hence, plenty of resources will become available to you. [Learn more](link) about how a VPN works in detail.

Speaking of AdGuard VPN, it has several functions:
* hides your real whereabouts and stays anonymous
* allows to bypass geo-blocking of some websites by hiding your location and changing an IP adress.
* encrypts your traffic to protect your data from tracking.

 The next advantage of AdGuard VPN for iOS is our own VPN protocol, the reliable feature for uncompromised security. And, of course, there is a wide range of the lightning-fast servers. How many exactly? 50 locations worldwide! Choose the most suitable and surf the web!

## How to use AdGuard VPN

Using AdGuard VPN is quite easy. In the main screen you can see the Connect/Disconnect button and the lists of available servers. There servers have their own location (the certain country and the city) and ping indicator. The ping describes a speed (in milliseconds) of data submission between an user's device and a server: for example, choosing the server with the ping of 22 ms means that information from the device will reach this server for 22 milliseconds. So the lower this rate, the faster is your connection. In AdGuard VPN you can choose among 50 loctions from 16 countries worlwide.

## Lists of exclusions

You can find exclusion feature by tapping the middle button below. Then you will see two exclusion lists â€” for Regular and Selective Modes. In the first list you can add those websites on which AdGuard VPN won't work. In the Selective Mode, conversely, our VPN will only work on websites you added to the list below. You can add domains (e.g. google.com) or subdomains (e.g. *.google.com) of websites in two ways: you can enter them manually in the app or add a webiste right from the browser by clicking the share button and finding AdGuard VPN in the opened list below.

Another useful feature is the import/export of exclusion lists.  It can work either on all websites except those added to exclusions, or only on websites added to exclusions. You can add domains (e.g. google.com) or subdomains (e.g. *google.com) to both lists and switch from one to another if necessary. Another great feature is the import/export of exclusion lists. You can do it by following the next four steps:

1. Open AdGuard VPN on the device/in the browser from where you want to export your lists of exclusions. Find the appropriate section and click on the "Export" button. The exclusions.zip archive will be downloaded.

2. There are two TXT files inside the archive, each for Regular and Selective lists. Add more exclusions to them, delete the existing ones, rename files (but more on this later), or just leave the archive with files as it is.

3. When transferring between different devices, don't forget to send the zip file to the device for import. For example, if you import exclusion lists from your Android device to your PC, make sure to send the zip file to your PC beforehand.

4. Open AdGuard VPN on the device/in the browser where you want to export the archive with the ready lists of exclusions. Find the appropriate section, click on the "Import" button and select the archive.

## Additional customization

You can configure Adguard VPN for iOS as you need by selecting different options:

1. Operating mode: the general one uses AdGuard VPN own protocol, the integrated one allows AdGuard VPN and AdGuard ad blocker to work together by using IPSec protocol
2. [DNS](https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/dns-filtering#what-is-dns) (Domain name system) server. Its purpose is to translate websites' names into something browsers can understand, i.e. IP addresses. You can choose one of the popular and reliable DNS servers by AdGuard, Google, Cloudfare, etc.
3. Wi-Fi auto-protection: VPN will automatically turn on when the device connects to a Wi-Fi network
4. Theme: system default, dark or light (available in iOS 13 and later versions)
5. Diagnostic info: locally stored technical information about the device and connections (IP addess, ID, Ping, etc.). You can use this information in case of any technical problems by sending it to our Support team.
