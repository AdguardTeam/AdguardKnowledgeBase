AdGuard is often compared with well-known browser extensions like Adblock and Adblock Plus. In this article, we will describe the main advantages of AdGuard over its competitors.

AdGuard apps' advantages are largely due to the limitations that are imposed on browser-based extensions. Adblock and Adblock Plus, technologically, are not able to remove all the ads on the page. That’s because AdGuard processes a page even before it is loaded into the browser, removing all advertising elements. Extensions work on a different principle based on the ad-blocking capabilities of a browser. That is why an additional page [post-processing](http://adguard.com/en/how-ads-blocked.html#cosmetic) step is required to hide the blocked elements. If you've ever used Adblock, then you surely noticed how the hidden banners "blink".

The second advantage of AdGuard is that it is a separate program, not a browser extension. AdGuard can block ads in any browser. Whatever browser you use, whether it's Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer, or Yandex, with AdGuard you will forget about irritating online ads.

If you use a rare browser, it can be a problem for Adblock and Adblock Plus because these extensions exist only for the most popular browsers. With AdGuard, you won’t have these problems. You can easily add your browser to the protected list.

And that’s not all. AdGuard can block ads in Skype, uTorrent, and many other common programs. Just add them to the list of browsers and restart.

Apart from blocking ads, AdGuard gives you a lot of additional tools. Perhaps the most important of them is the phishing filter. This module operates with the help of a constantly updated database of malicious and phishing sites. AdGuard uses two main sources: the list of Google Safe Browsing and AdGuard’s own lists. We are constantly monitoring data on the safety of websites and quickly improve our filters.

Some users use AdGuard instead of an antivirus program, some with it. In any case, AdGuard seriously increases the security of your computer on the network.

There is a popular misconception that Adblock and Adblock Plus almost never consume resources. But is it really so?

To check this, we will use the Task Manager in the Google Chrome browser.

Note that even in the most simple settings with one single filter enabled, extensions consume 100 megabytes of RAM. AdGuard consumes almost the same amount of resources while offering many more features.

To sum up:

**1. AdGuard blocks ads before they are loaded into the browser.**

**2. AdGuard really saves your traffic.**

**3. AdGuard is compatible with all browsers.**

**4. AdGuard can remove ads from Skype, uTorrent, and other applications.**

**5. AdGuard helps protect you from viruses and scams.**
