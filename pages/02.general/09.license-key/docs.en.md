1. **Standard** - allows you to activate Adguard on Windows PC or Mac.
2. **Mobile** - allows you to activate Adguard on your Mobile device.
2. **Premium** - mobile and standard in a single license. Allows you to activate both mobile device and computer with the same license key.
4. **Bonus License** - is given for winning any contests or prize draws. Equivalent to standard license.
5. **Beta-test** - special type of license for Adguard beta-testers. Program activated with this type of license is automatically updated to the latest available beta.

#### Transfering license to another computer

Once the program is activated with a license key, the license key is “bound” to the device on which activation was held. License key may be activated on a limited number of devices. If the license key is already used on the maximum possible number of devices, you need to unbind it from one of them before using this key again. You can do it in your [Adguard Account](#account-functions).


<a id="recovery"></a>
## How to recover my license key?

You can easily find out which license keys belong to you in your [Adguard Account](#account).

The binding of your license key with your account is held with your email address, which was used for purchasing of Adguard.
