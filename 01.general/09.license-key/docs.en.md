<a id="activation_info"></a>
#### Transferring license to another device

When you activate the program with a license key, this key gets bound to the device used to perform the activation. The same license key can be activated on a limited number of devices. If the key has already been used on the maximum allowed number of devices, you need to reset it before using this key again. You can do it in your [AdGuard Account](#account-functions).


<a id="recovery"></a>
## How to recover my license key?

You can easily check which license keys belong to you in your [AdGuard Account](#account).

The license key is bound to your account via the email address you used to purchase AdGuard.

**Please note** that it is often not enough to just find out what your license key is. If it was already used on another computer, it’s necessary to unbind it from that computer through the [AdGuard Account](#account) before using it again.


<a id="account"></a>
## How to register the AdGuard Account?

When you purchase an AdGuard license key, your personal AdGuard account is automatically registered for the email address used for the purchase. An email is sent to this address with the details of the automatic registration of your personal account and an activation link.  If for some reason you miss this email or forget your password, you can [recover your password](http://adguard.com/recovery_password.html).

If you don’t have an AdGuard account, we suggest that you create one by clicking [this link](http://adguard.com/register.html).

An AdGuard account allows you to manage your license keys, their binding to your devices, and your purchase history.

Learn more about the account features [below](#account-functions).


<a id="account-functions"></a>
## What functions are available in my AdGuard personal account?

When you enter the AdGuard [personal account](https://adguard.com/en/login.html) you will see the list of your license keys and their current status.

This is how you can manage your AdGuard licenses and subscriptions.

#### Renew or upgrade
You can renew your key for another year, switch to lifetime protection, or upgrade to a family license (which covers more devices).


#### Unbind from the device
When you activate a license key on a device, this device gets added to the list under the license key. The number of devices that can use the same license key is limited. If you reach this limit, you need to unbind an existing device from the license key before using this key on a new device.

To unbind your license key from a device, click the cross icon next to that device, as shown in this picture:

<img src="https://cdn.adguard.com/public/Adguard/kb/newscreenshots/En/General/unbind-en.png?" max-width="900" />

#### Change card details or cancel subscription
To do so, find the subscription you need to manage and click on the card icon near it:

<img src="https://cdn.adguard.com/public/Adguard/kb/newscreenshots/En/General/unsubscribe-change-card.png?" width="900" />

<a name="renewal"></a>
## What to do after the key was renewed?

After renewing AdGuard for the next year, you should restart the program/app or update the license status in the License section for the changes to take effect.
